# Pam Alco-roll-ic

This mod is inspired by [spacechase0](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/users/34250790) glorious modification [Spenny](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/2755) which let Penny spin the whole time. For me, the idea of a spinning villager was so funny that I decide to let Pam roll a bit when she walks
